Description
===========
ruby-sysaid is a Ruby-based wrapper for the SysAid SOAP API. It helps abstract
the nonsense that is dealing with SOAP on Ruby and provides a clean interface
for dealing with SysAid objects.

Usage
=====
    # Required
    SysAid.server_settings = {
      :endpoint => "sysaid.server.com",
      :account => "account",
      :username => "username",
      :password => "password"
    }
    
    # find_by_* any field valid for SysAid
    ticket = service.find_by_id(45)
    ticket = service.find_by_responsibility("somebody")
    ticket = service.find_by_status(3)
    
    # Example of modifying a ticket
    ticket.title = "Updated"
    ticket.save
    
    # Deleting a ticket
    ticket.delete
    
    # Creating a new ticket
    ticket = SysAid::Ticket.new
    ticket.title = "New ticket"
    ticket.assignedTo = "somebody"
    ticket.save
    puts ticket.id   # the ID of the new ticket

Additional
==========
If you'd like to debug the SOAP messages being sent back and forth, add
this (optional) setting: SysAid.server_settings[:debug] = STDERR.

The Ruby SOAP driver was generated by a fork of soap4r from https://github.com/mumboe/soap4r.

The WSDL file used was from SysAid v8.1.
